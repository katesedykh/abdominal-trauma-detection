# RSNA Abdominal Trauma Detection AI Challenge

This repository contains the work of Elena Gado, Chiara Matti, Ekaterina Sedykh for CS-502 Deep Learning in Biomedicine course, project is a part of the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma Detection AI Challenge. Our project aims to develop a deep learning model that aids in the rapid and accurate detection of abdominal injuries from CT scans.

## Project Overview

Abdominal trauma is a critical health issue that requires timely and accurate diagnosis to ensure effective treatment. Our project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze CT images and detect injuries, potentially improving patient care and survival rates.
